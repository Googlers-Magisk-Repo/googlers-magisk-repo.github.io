                    "body": "The most significant new feature of this release is Kotlin code support! PR #247 was finally merged into main. Compiling Kotlin code still needs an Android 8+ device though, so only the -minApi26 version supports Kotlin.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n - Reading debug logs from projects. A new activity for that, the Logcat Reader, was added, and to start seeing logs there, run your project and open the Logcat Reader in Sketchware Pro. (#257)\r\n - Symbol pair auto-completion in the code editor can now be turned off. (#402)\r\n - Upgrade to sora-editor v0.14.0.\r\n - Upgrade to Iyxan23/zipalign-java:96fd6b30c928015847264b27b0d2dd407f3e8895.\r\n - Some performance improvements to the DEX merging step. (0f4fc74e98e74595fdcee1423f0b578767038bea)\r\n - Using resource strings in the text and hint property of Views now works! Set e.g. `@string/greeting` as text or hint, and the View code will use the resource string, not escape the @. (0f27cac78263556793e4796ed77e19967b9ec336)\r\n - You can now tweak the filename of SWB backups. (#277)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n - Custom Variables are shown in the Variable Palette and can also be removed again.\r\n - The aligning APK step was entirely removed after pressing the Run button, as only exports to e.g. Google Play need alignment.\r\n - The crash after the Aligning APK\u2026 step was fixed.\r\n - Downloading Local libraries won't crash the app anymore. (299d341b1948866f15921fdcf5bc41b29c7a0be2)\r\n - Fonts added via the Font Manager now actually work at runtime. You'll have to remove old fonts and add them again though.\r\n - A Custom Block Palette having an invalid color won't crash the app anymore. (a332fcb6be1ae5e2ab3db8b8d2f05a8a397329ab)\r\n - RadioButtons' checked property now work. (27f874aeaf24811ecddc2b09d151bcc05a7371c2)\r\n - Built-in Menu Blocks work again! (bba8b3b9dcf2dcc9b0d3dc817fda9b179b3686fd)\r\n - Zooming in code in e.g. the source code preview, or in general, in dialogs where sora-editor is used will zoom into the code editor content, not the activity content. (c7336e96c2f1a6bae2eec980aa6ac6d38922c4cc)\r\n - Trying to remove a Variable or List used in another Event will show an error message again.\r\n\r\n## New in version with Kotlin support\r\n - Java Manager was renamed to Java/Kotlin Manager. It can also create and import new Kotlin classes.\r\n - Obviously, Kotlin compiling!\r\n\r\n## Known issues/bugs\r\nBefore reporting any issues, please first check here if they're not already known, or already were reported in another Issue.\r\n\r\n - Java/Kotlin Manager has no icon for Kotlin source code files.\r\n - There's no Kotlin syntax highlighting available in the code editor.\r\n - Adding new AdMob units doesn't work. See issue #490 for details on that bug.\r\n - ProGuard somehow renaming R classes to `r`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n - If you need a version that **supports Android 5** and higher, get v6.4.0-rc04-**minApi21**. It has **no support for AAB output**.\r\n - Otherwise, if you need one with Kotlin support, and also **AAB output support**, get v6.4.0-rc04-**minApi26**. As the name says, it only supports **Android 8 and higher**.",

(#392, 2bb7b2a9cf355273ed5813670d2fe1fb8ae81274)\r\n - APK aligning failing due to dynamically linked zipalign binaries was fixed too! (#395, 45cc37f7150c37b7964651c04fa661f55991d7df)\r\n - Adding a RewardedVideoAd Component is not possible anymore when not having AdMob enabled. (5e898ae02daf26398e8e3ea43c32c17901e77d86)\r\n - Projects using OneSignal won't have to rely on e.g. XML Command Blocks to work (/ at least get installed) on Android 12 when also targeting that Android version. (661780f639219932035188b1257204e09a32ad28)\r\n - When exporting a signed AAB or APK, the file gets signed first, then zipaligned. [Apparently that's what you should do now.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/827528331721048084/975379539075166238/unknown.png) (c7ff8ea131f47eb2288a40488c779653d99a3921)\r\n - The context menu in Java Manager or App Components shouldn't be weirdly dark with dark text anymore. (ef0b9d0290d98917fa147b27a686f9b395ff2fdf)\r\n - A typo in the onScrollChanged Event label was fixed at last. (60cdf9a4179caba48e89b397ad2fc444635e3737)\r\n - Projects using Glide should no longer crash at runtime. (9fb5aaf2b0e039a369e1899a6e22fead0c8cdace)\r\n - Clearing the app cache will no longer make compiling projects not work anymore until you clear the app's data. (6bc31f7e8d97a896bd1fcff0a0883864837e94d0)\r\n - Some other compiling assets that need to be extracted will also be extracted to the cache directory, just like e.g. built-in libraries' DEX files. (6bc31f7e8d97a896bd1fcff0a0883864837e94d0)\r\n - Built-in Extra Blocks can now be overridden using Custom Blocks again. (0929291412b1f6c07865d0af459d728b21a8468d)\r\n\r\n## Major thanks\r\nWe'd like to thank @Iyxan23 for implementing zipalign in Java, started by Sketchware Pro needing an alternative method to align ZIP archives. [The library can be found here](https://github.com/Iyxan23/zipalign-java). Thank you for making v6.4.0-rc03's release that quickly possible!\r\n\r\n## Full Changelog\r\nYou can find it here: https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/compare/v6.4.0-rc02...v6.4.0-rc03",

                    "body": "This is another long overdue release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n - Built-in library upgrades, as well as finally changing their internal names to mention the actual library name in e.g. dexs.zip. (4030187aa7451baea2eac6cb947dc4934119863c...96298588b6f88d5cbbbe04485110d16b3b5e01eb, e280c1fc9be0ad73017635a38ca947a14a5e1804)\r\n - Views can now have an orientation of \"none\", which removes the property `android:orientation=\"\u2026\"` from Views' XML code entirely, all without any Command Blocks. (775e4d04d9fef873c65efcb91cb5568fe6952061)\r\n - APKs now get aligned using `zipalign` before getting signed. (f67c19537cef0da9bf636799ebc6283ba0b96a05)\r\n - Quick AndroidManifest.xml viewer in AndroidManifest Manager (81813a0541311daa0733ba341fad0deadb5049c3)\r\n - AndroidManifest Manager will now use the new code editor if not disabled in Mod Settings for App Components. (f1a26461869f7f036e2dc3fcd58915b7ce865ceb)\r\n - Upgrade of code editor library to upstream sora-editor v0.11.1\r\n - When exporting an APK / AAB, you can now also decide to not sign the APK / AAB. They will get a different output name, though. (de780e71ce247ad9517a97baf0b0be6a6cb8b188)\r\n - Sometimes directories or files needed for compiling get deleted. Sketchware Pro now detects and tells you about that. If it's directories, you can create them with a single click. (54f9706d6270cbfa38a6cca1f9f239c64caa3330)\r\n - The Source Code Viewer got improved. It now uses the new code editor library to show code, and launching it is instant. It generates the project's code asynchronized so that the UI doesn't hang anymore. (ae9e4980a4a0c15fe282d2b0a135b5d9a1ec3f0e)\r\n - `${applicationId}` in AndroidManifest.xml will now automatically get replaced with the project's package name. (91eaff060194e8d7ef1ca68074aa131ca7cb56af)\r\n - R8 was updated to v3.3.28. (a7c2e4ff95bc70efe2f535c2d859d10b29045853)\r\n - A new barebones splash screen that only waits until the system's ready to open MainActivity. (390ed037c90c39c6b81b054b9fcb32ea2b4ac771)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n - App doesn't crash without access to storage anymore. (650b78fe28c5cd135868bfbe16b8c5a751065aae)\r\n - Resource Manager doesn't crash on older Android versions anymore. (f81de8f3e8ab4a78d9c7dbbdad2b07c5e8249f53)\r\n - BottomNavigationView's onNavigationItemSelected Event works again. (3a4e17e55076b019b0d1430249163e6a2bcd2e0a)\r\n - Showing a file's source quickly now works for XML files, including changes made via Command Blocks. (80201534b0973efb3fe0397f2077a3ce44a7be5a)\r\n - You can clear the saved last compile error again. (470074b40c4aed1bbbe5c24d9670a1043740ec88)\r\n - Projects can have the `<queries>` tag in AndroidManifest.xml again. (none, since this was caused by me having forgotten to update aapt2's binaries in the APK)\r\n - The blue \"[ViewPager] setFragmentAdapter [FragmentAdapter] TabCount (number)\" Block works again. (ef4c3a59f60fa8913804c0cbda2dc61f759d2d45)\r\n - If a wrong key store password was entered while signing an APK or AAB, you will now be told about that instead of getting an endless progress bar. (78a2a1a0680f4dba5eb2e9bde1030f09038d223c)\r\n - You can't add more DynamicLink Components if Firebase is not enabled. (0656216dcf80d9364ce890055f184749ddc403e6)\r\n - The InterstitialAd Block to show an ad doesn't crash projects at runtime anymore if used outside of the onAdLoaded Event / the ad hasn't been loaded yet. (9c95577b491b1b7049496711e8bc3afc4347f1d2)\r\n - While creating DEX files out of project files, d8 now knows about used libraries' JAR paths. That allows it to desugar default methods into code if targetting older Android versions, and makes for example the exoplayer library work when used. (875e010bcdedf13b9a69325da2b6331e59d817c1)\r\n - Adding fonts via Font Manager should now work on all Android versions again. Sound Manager following soon. (16b72aa81a53bd776bc816ae6bdaf0801945566d)\r\n - The built-in library localbroadcastmanager-1.0.0's DEX file now actually contains its classes. (e0bf549c5e953045a349f455d1b5aec1b301e6ea)\r\n - The RewardedVideoAd Component got updated to work with the updated AdMob built-in library version. You will have to migrate Events to new ones over. (too many, lol)\r\n\r\n## Changes that aren't features or fixes\r\n - Resource Block Selector Menus have been deprecated / removed. Use the Code Editor option instead. (3de650c44b4d1d20b6a02b4f93f416321981a054)\r\n - The Language Settings menu from the main drawer has been removed as it's not working anymore. (7aee8ce896c47a7a4463317a98f4e2309a35935b)\r\n\r\n## Update on Sketchware Pro's build system\r\n - We've migrated to Android Studio fully now. This means that it's even easier to contribute to Sketchware Pro!\r\n - Unfortunately, that also forces us to release two APKs from now on. We're releasing an APK with support for Android 5 and higher but without AAB output support, and one with support for only Android 8 and above devices, but because of that, with the AAB output feature. You can check the APK's minimum SDK version (21 for no AAB output support, 26 for with), or the version name to find out which version an APK is.\r\n\r\n## Full Changelog\r\nYou can find it here: https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/compare/v6.4.0-rc01...v6.4.0-rc02",

This time, you can start using Events just like with v6.3.0 fix1 and vanilla Sketchware.\r\n - Quick Previews of XML files! This was surprisingly hard to implement, as far as I can remember. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/82c6db17cbe2e2767fafd1cc30c616c5fff13349)\r\n - A much better \"About Sketchware Pro\" screen, containing expandable Sketchware Pro version changelogs, and a work-in-progress tab to view Major Changes made to Sketchware Pro since v6.3.0 fix1.\r\n - Generated AABs containing generated ProGuard mappings if those were enabled. Useful when uploading your AAB to Google Play. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/197d7d020e0cc53e8bc6e5e0bd99081c4339dcd9)\r\n - The screen staying turned on while exporting a project. You can now finally leave Sketchware Pro working while resting. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/ea7a4fa929e3d6bc83dc0cf71048d5e11decc889)\r\n - Images imported in Resource Manager and Asset Manager show previews now! [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/239b1d5d92c0ed9dc28f9d78f9cf289672fe3aec)\r\n - Improvements to the Compile Log screen: It now has a toolbar, and features display options. Also, the last compile error will open there too, now. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/00cc7dcb9b3077f593911d4d103f7c793bde046b)\r\n - Being able to restore multiple SWBs at once. Every backup has its own \"restore embedded Local libraries?\" dialog, by the way. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/18acc03ec4408c1ebdbde002356a047405ead6b7)\r\n - Backing up projects now backs them up into a folder with the name of the project. Inside that folder, the backups of that project will be stored. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/cf3eb633c5f1d5ba4b6135e95468151c216b1400)\r\n - An updated version of the built-in Material Design Components / part of AppCompat for projects, which allows your projects to have a Material You style! That is **completely optional** though, and to apply that, you need to currently mess around with Resource Manager. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/dafa352007432cfaa080c69cada6a85649c3caec)\r\n - ProGuard v7.1.1 in Sketchware Pro. Major upgrade is it being able to process Java 11 Local libraries. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/922744e44da57939f1db34cec384a2aec7b972c8)\r\n - A ScrollView in Mod Settings and the Tools screen. Some small-display devices will benefit from this.

This explains the issues of v6.4.0 Beta 6 with many WebView-using projects, for example.\r\n - Exporting a project to Android Studio failing with \"file not found\" errors. What a difference simple \"folder exists?\" checks can make. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/eb21a9662cdf36b276835d61fae2d57bb0ffbdb7)\r\n - Some devices having issues extracting built-in libraries, which explains the \"\u2026/res: No such file or directory.\" errors when projects are at AAPT2. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/36e8ad9f604a8b2af37b59757c73a8924b42da25)\r\n - Views, such as TextInputLayout, in Lists' Custom Views (e.g. RecyclerView), causing errors at runtime. This needed a patch to vanilla Sketchware's default generated Adapter code. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/137d97f9af2478905993fdd333ec26c2ba562072)\r\n - AndroidManifest.xml injections after the default AppTheme not getting applied. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/61be449945d2c92bfa2fabb03b872489654c0876)\r\n - Using multiple FragmentAdapter Components in a single Activity should be fine now, and its corresponding Block got changed too. Make sure to replace the current one with the updated one, or else no Adapter will be set. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/60aa166d11a257a346c094405ab64e66d0c0a86b)\r\n - SearchView's onQueryText* Events should not throw compile errors anymore. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/1498c11a03dd7762845d76e16edee63e09624a2d)\r\n - AdMob AdViews not properly working. Note that now they show test ads when running your project, and only real ads when you export your project, just like Interstitial Ads!\r\n - Some AABs containing invalidly compressed files, most often videos or sounds in assets / res/raw-[config]. [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/0ce1bad9c99d9b89b205d428854578b939c52df4)\r\n - Exported AABs not containing non-class files from Local and built-in Libraries' JARs. Now they do.

See [this message](https://discord.com/channels/790686719753846785/790749749522464779/908817727878201424) for the announcement again: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40118124/147373406-21f9e889-5813-4d1a-b02d-fb14e8267402.png)\r\n [View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/63e8a407b07a92d011a164bbdf19d0d0b8e37494)\r\n - /Internal storage/.sketchware/debug.txt now contains information about the used Sketchware Pro version.

[View commit](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/commit/db6f44f92b531ed497f7e2be3fe58cba01e64db0)\r\n - DEX files don't get merged into just few ones anymore starting with this version when just running the project, not exporting it. That'll save some precious time of yours.

From now on, you have to open Component manager to refresh Custom Components though.\r\n - More than a single decimal in project's version name, version name and extra is now a ` `. (If using advanced version control dialog)\r\n - The green \"add source directly\" block is now available in the default Import Event if you open the Operator palette.\r\n - Some improvements to exporting a project to Android Studio: It now includes imported Java files, resources, assets, and native libraries.\r\n - Improvements to the Local library downloader, now you can have *custom repositories* it looks up. The default one will automatically get generated during the first time at `/Internal storage/.sketchware/libs/repositories.json`.\r\n - (Might be removed later) Adding `tools:remove=\"orientation\"` into any View's inject attribute will remove the `android:orientation` attribute of it.\r\n - (WIP) Built-in AdMob fixes! You'll have to completely rework ads, but at least they kind of work now. You will need all 4 new blocks in exactly this order: ![h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40118124/134823600-8488bc81-cc5f-4f57-9926-2ec86debea86.png)  Support for onAdShown and onAdClosed is coming soon.\r\n   There's still a catch: You need to use an XML Command Block in AndroidManifest.xml to set your correct app ID there. [Click here for more details on what exactly to replace.](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start#configure_your_app)\r\n\r\n**What's been fixed?**\r\n - The app complaining for no reason about any List in Logic Editor\r\n - Merging DEX files while building a project taking ages\r\n - Generated AABs not including Native libraries\r\n - General compiling failing on some devices due to the removal of the `android:largeHeap=\"true\"` attribute in Sketchware Pro's AndroidManifest.xml",

Ever since Android introduced [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html) in Android 8.0, Magisk has been constantly fighting against the increasingly complex partitioning and early mount setups of all kinds of devices, sometimes with weird OEM specific implementations. It got to a point that `magiskinit` had become so complicated that few people (including myself!) were aware of every detail, and maintaining this piece of software like this was clearly not sustainable. After many months of planning (yes, this whole re-architecture has been in my head for a long time) and some help from external contributors, a whole new `sepolicy` injection mechanism is introduced into Magisk, solving the \"SELinux Problem\" once and for all.\r\n\r\nSince this is a full paradigm shift on how Magisk hot-patch the device at boot, several behaviors that many developers implicitly relied on might not exist. For example, Magisk no longer patches fstabs in most scenarios, which means AVB will remain intact; some custom kernels rely on AVB being stripped out for them by Magisk.\r\n\r\n### MagiskSU Security Enhancements\r\n\r\nThe superuser functionality of Magisk has not seen much changes ever since its introduction. v25 focuses on making root permission management more accurate and secure:\r\n\r\n- Add a whole new package tracking system to ensure malicious UID reuse attack cannot be performed\r\n- Properly support and implement the UX in the Magisk app for packages using `sharedUserId`\r\n- Enforce root manager APK signature verification to combat the rampant unofficial Magisk app \"mods\"\r\n\r\nMany might not realize, but using a trusted, unmodified Magisk app is really important. Magisk's root daemon treats the Magisk app differently and gives it blanket root access without any restrictions. A modded Magisk app can potentially backdoor your device.\r\n\r\nAnd in case some of you are about to put on your tin foil hats, this is not designed to \"vendor lock-in\"; the goal is to make sure your root management app comes from the same developer of the underlying root implementation. Magisk's build system allows custom distributors to use its own signing keys, and in addition, I am also providing official debug builds which skips any signature verification for development.\r\n\r\n### Full Changelog: [here](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/changes.html)\r\n",
